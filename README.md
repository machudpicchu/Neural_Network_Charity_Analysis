# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Analysis
With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions (15 pt)
### Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification (3 pt)

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
