# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Analysis
This challenge is about helping a co-worker to use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier.  This classifier uses features in the provided dataset that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the hypothetical company that is considering investments.  The file includes more than 30,000 organizations with many different relevant data points as well as their success rates from the past that will be used to predict future success.

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing
* **What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?**

* **What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?**

* **What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data**

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* **How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?**
In the end I added four total layers to my model with 151 neurons.  I used three different activation functions.  It was mostly trial and error as I was trying to improve the results of my model that these decisions were made.
* **Were you able to achieve the target model performance?**

* **What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?**
